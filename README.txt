Instructions to run code:
command to type: python + OurPythonProgram + "filename" + flag

examples:
python main.py test.txt 1 
python main.py test.txt 2

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Our code does not handle cases were an incorrect file name or incorrect flag is given, be sure to input correct filenames and either the numeric number 1 or 2 for the flag 
- It is noteworthy that sometimes the standard Trie seems to get beat by the TST Trie in search cases 
- Program follows all output directions and passes all test cases given in rubric for autocorrect and search
- Note we do not prompt the user for additional searches after the first one has been ran. Please run the program an additional time for an additional search
